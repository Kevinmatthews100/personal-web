  <h1>Music</h1>

  <p>
    I am a 2020 Penn State graduate, where I studied music technology, and tuba under <a

      href="https://velvetuba.com"
      target="_blank">Velvet Brown</a
    >. Having been part of the Penn State Tuba Euphonium studio, and having surrounded myself with many talented low
    brass players in college, much of my music is written for tuba, euphonium, and trombone.
  </p>
  <p>
    My first piece "Horizons" for tuba euphonium ensemble was premiered at the 2019 International Tuba Euphonium
    Conference in Iowa. Since then, I've written music for tuba, electronics, piano, and brass band. In addition to
    classical composition, I have worked on a variety of collaborative projects. I worked on a video game soundtrack for
    electronic instruments in collaboration with Penn State's School of Visual Arts. As a recording studio engineer at
    Penn State's School of Music, I worked with musicians to track and mix high quality recordings in a professional
    recording studio environment. Also, I have been commissioned to write arrangements of pop tunes for <a

    >, who perform at Knoebels Amusement Park in Elysburg Pennsylvania.
  </p>

  <h2>Horizons</h2>
  <p>
    "Horizons" is a three movement piece for Tuba Euphonium ensemble takes the listener through the transformation the
    sky makes from the end of one day, to the beginning the next. In writing this music, I drew inspiration from my
    impression of the literal colors seen when looking at the sky during these times of day and night, as well as
    inspiration from possible symbolic interpretations of this kind of change: the end of one thing, transformation, and
    the start of another. Score and instrument parts are avalible for purchase at <a

  <h2>Song of Antecedence</h2>
  <p>
    This piece is a minimalist piece for piano and tuba. It was written to challenge the idea that solo tuba music must
    be technically challenging to be considered a valid piece of repertoire. The recording below features my college
    tuba professor, Velvet Brown. Spitfire strings have also been added to this recording, but are not required for
    performance.

  <h2>Since you scrolled this far...</h2>
  <p>
    Check out this episode in College Marching's "Take the Field" documentary series made while I was in Penn State's
    marching band in 2018. I look back fondly on playing in the band, and I think this documentary does a fantastic job
    illustrating why.
