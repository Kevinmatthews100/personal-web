# Hello

I'm a full stack developer at [Label Interactive](https://www.labelinteractive.com) primarily working on e-commerce services for a large New England retail chain, processing 500,000+ monthly orders. I'm also a published composer, an active contractor for original cinematic music, and a research assistant at The Penn State University School of Music.
